**Project Title: Creating Cohorts of Songs**

**Overview:**
This project aims to build an advanced recommendation system for Spotify by clustering songs based on their unique characteristics. Through detailed data analysis and machine learning, the goal is to enhance personalized recommendations, helping Spotify users discover music aligned with their tastes. By understanding the features that drive song popularity, the system will suggest albums or tracks most relevant to each user.

**Key Steps:**

**-Data Cleaning:**
  Eliminate duplicates, handle missing values, and address outliers to ensure the dataset is clean and reliable for subsequent analysis.

**-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  Investigate musical features such as danceability, energy, valence, loudness, acousticness, and tempo.
  Explore relationships between these features and song popularity, discovering patterns that influence user preferences.
  Analyze which albums contain the most popular tracks and should be recommended, using visualizations and statistics to support these insights.

**-Feature Engineering:**
  Generate new variables or refine existing ones to better capture the essence of a song’s features.
  Study how song attributes and popularity evolve over time to provide dynamic insights into user preferences.

**-Dimensionality Reduction:**
  If the dataset has many features, apply techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality while preserving key information.
  This helps simplify complex datasets and focus on the most influential features.

**-Cluster Analysis:**
  Use clustering techniques like K-means or Hierarchical Clustering to group songs into meaningful cohorts based on shared characteristics.
  Determine the optimal number of clusters and interpret the defining features of each cluster.
  Analyze how these clusters can improve Spotify’s recommendation algorithms by providing users with more relevant song suggestions.

**Outcome**
The project will produce well-structured cohorts of songs, enabling Spotify to deliver more accurate and personalized song recommendations. By understanding how features like energy, valence, and tempo impact popularity, the system will provide users with music that matches their preferences, improving user engagement and satisfaction on the platform.
